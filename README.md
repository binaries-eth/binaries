### Binaries

Create your own parametric graphics.

Minting is easy, coming up with your own art is hard. This project lets you experience the pain of discovering the perfect composition from open set of possibilities. Take one of the existing tokens as a starting point, experiment with the parameters and design your own piece.

Disclaimer: contract is not audited, so its use is extremely risky. Actively looking for security feedback.

### Tokenomics

* Minting open for everyone.
* Supply is capped at 255 tokens.
* Mint price is based on a bonding curve x<sup>2</sup>/1024 with guaranteed 80% burn price from the reserve.
* 10% from each mint is equally distributed among existing token holders.
* 10% is held as a reserve for the project development.

### Ideas what's next?

Project is open for suggestions, for now via GitHub issues. Some ideas:

* Adding new features like:
  * colours
  * animations
  * wasm support
* Setting up DAO supporting:
  * development of easy to use web3 tools for creatives, like wysiwyg, no-code etc.
  * art buying
